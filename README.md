# Disorder order clAssifier by Rapid and User-friendly Machine, DARUMA
DARUMA (Disorder order clAssifier by Rapid and User-friendly Machine) is a predictor for intrinsically disordered regions(IDRs). 
DARUMA enables rapid prediction by using a simple convolutional neural network that uses physicochemical properties of amino acids as features.
Developed by Fukuchi Lab, Maebashi Institute of Technology.
